# Collection of notes on different languages

I really don't like needing to bookmark like 20 different sites with different grammatical concepts. So this repository contains my personal notes on grammar and problematic parts of languages  I sometimes need to check. While public I don't think it will be of a much use to anyone.

In English I have C1/C2 level, so the notes should include more complex concepts. German section is just what I've had written years ago while in highschool so the quality is questionable at best.
